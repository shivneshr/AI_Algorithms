## Search algorithms which solves the n-queens problem efficiently
This project focuses on different search techniques in AI to effectively solve an adaptation of n-queens problem. Three search techniques have been identified
* Depth First search - performs well on sparse inputs and medium search space
* Breadth First search - performs well on dense inputs and small search space
* Simulated Annealing - performs well on sparse inpus and large search space

The goal of the code is to analyze various search techniques performance on various sizes and formations of search spaces and how effectively the algorithm prunes the search space to coverge to a solution faster. This code was tested against varying sizes of search spaces.
